# Predictive-Reasoning-of-Habitual-Kidney-Disease
Case Study Situation: Imagine a busy hospital environment where doctors are constantly striving to provide timely and accurate diagnoses for patients. One of the significant challenges they face is diagnosing Kidney Disease early. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management, but the traditional process involves multiple tests and can be both time-consuming and expensive. As a Data Science student, how would you approach to solve this problem? 

Task: As a part of my academic coursework, I was tasked with developing a machine learning model that could predict the presence of Kidney Disease based on a dataset of patient medical records. The goal was to create a reliable, quick, and cost-effective preliminary diagnostic tool that doctors could use to identify patients at risk of Kidney Disease, thereby improving patient outcomes and easing the diagnostic process.

Action: I embarked on this project following a structured approach(Data Science Lifecycle), ensuring that each step was carefully executed.

Data Collection: I started by gathering the dataset, which contained various medical attributes of patients, such as age, blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin, and sugar levels.
Ensuring the data was comprehensive and ready for analysis was crucial. Therefore, the dataset was loaded into the notebook from a CSV file.

Data Cleaning: The first step in cleaning the data was to handle any missing values. I opted to drop rows with missing values to maintain data integrity. I also ensured that each column had the correct data type (i.e., converting categorical to numerical if needed), which is vital for accurate analysis and model training.

Data Exploration and Data Analysis: To understand the dataset better, I performed descriptive statistical analysis (Basic statistical details like mean, standard deviation, etc., of numerical columns) to summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the datasetâ€™s distribution.
Visualizations are powerful tools in data science. I used histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to visualize data distributions and relationships between features through libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
These steps helped in identifying patterns and relationships in the data, which are critical for feature engineering and model selection.

Feature Engineering: I standardized the numerical features to ensure they were on a comparable scale, which is particularly important for algorithms like neural networks. 
The numerical features are standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Categorical variables needed to be converted into a numerical format. I used one-hot encoding for this purpose.

Model Selection: Given the classification nature of the problem, I chose to use a Neural Network, implemented with Keras, for its powerful capability in handling complex datasets. 

Model Training: I split the dataset into training and testing sets with a 70-30 ratio to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. The neural network model was built with several layers, trained on the training data, and its performance tracked over 2000 epochs.

Model Evaluation: The model was evaluated on the test set to check its accuracy. To gain more insight into the model's performance, I generated a confusion matrix and plotted the accuracy over the training epochs.

Model Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, I saved the trained model so it could be used in real-world applications.

Conclusion: The result was a highly accurate predictive model for Kidney Disease, which can significantly aid in the early detection and management of the disease. The model was trained, evaluated, and saved for future deployment, offering a reliable tool for early detection of Kidney Disease. By integrating this model into the hospital's diagnostic process, doctors can make quicker and more informed decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing the healthcare burden. 
This project showcases the practical application of data science in solving real-world problems and demonstrates the transformative potential of machine learning in healthcare.
